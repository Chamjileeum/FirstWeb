    Not a big deal.
    TAG is a basic syntax of the HTML code. Simple is the important.
    With the sign <>, you can make a lot of "tricks" of the HTML code.<br><br>
    <p>Basically, the parent tags are these:<br>
      !DOCTYPE html<br>
      html<br>
      head<br>
      body<br>
      These point out that this script is made up of the syntax of HTML, or this is the head part, body part, or etc.</p>
    <p>Tag "title" sets the title of the webpage.</p>
    <p>Tag "h1" to "h6", make enormous to samll headlines.<br>
      The smaller the number is, the bigger the words become.</p>
    <p>Tag "strong" makes the word to bolded one.</p>
    <p>Tag "u" underlines the word.</p>
    <p>Tag "p" makes the paragraph, and using CSS, as "p style="margin-top:40px"", you can specify it.<br>
      Also there is the tag "br". This tag is the enter key of the html world. It just makes the new line.</p>
    <p>Tag "img" paste images. <br>
      Attribution "scr" is the abbreviaition of 'source'; this insists a name of the image file you want to show up.<br>
      Plus, attribution "width" litteraly sets the width of the image.<br>
      you can use this attribution as 'width="100%"'<br>
      Here's the example:<br><img src="coding.jpg" width="5%"><br></p>
    <p>Tag "ol" is tag of ordered list, and "ul" is tag of unordered tag.<br>
      "ol" marks the number in front of the word. but "ul" doesn't.</p>
    <p>Tag "a", which means 'anchor', links a webpage to the other.<br>
      Basically, attribution "href" is essential. It is the domain of the webpage you want to link toward.<br>
      Also, you can use the attribution "title" to show a bit of explanation if the mouse is on the link.<br></p>
